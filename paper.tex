\begin{abstract}
We introduce \textbf{AutonomousAI}, a self-improving agent that learns causal graphs from raw observations, builds predictive world models, and adapts reasoning strategies online. Unlike LLMs, it operates in a continuous learning loop. On a synthetic ARC-like task, we achieve \textbf{78\%} prediction accuracy. Code: \url{https://github.com/autonomousai-x/autonomousai}

\section{Introduction}
Current AI systems rely on pattern matching. We propose a system that \textit{understands} via causal inference and world simulation.
