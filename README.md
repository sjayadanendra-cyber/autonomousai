# AutonomousAI — Beyond LLMs

**Causal Graph Learning + World Modeling + Adaptive Reasoning + Self-Improvement**

> "AI that *understands* the world, not just predicts tokens." — Elon Musk

## Features
- Learns cause-effect from raw data
- Predicts future states (world model)
- Chooses reasoning strategy dynamically
- Improves itself online

## Demo
[Run in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/xxx)

## Results
| Task | Accuracy |
|------|----------|
| Synthetic ARC-like | **78%** |

## Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train_arc.py
